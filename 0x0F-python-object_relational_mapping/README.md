Python - Object-relational mapping
In this project, we linked two amazing worlds: Databases and Python!
In the first part, we used the module MySQLdb to connect to a MySQL database and execute your SQL queries.
In the second part, we used the module SQLAlchemy (don’t ask me how to pronounce it…) an Object Relational Mapper (ORM).
Several Resources was studied to achieve this; these includes:
